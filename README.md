## Overview

I build data-driven and AI-powered systems with the goal of delivering **trustworthy,
measurable solutions to real-world business problems**. My experience spans **data
engineering, data science, machine learning, and large language model (LLM) systems**,
where I focus on transforming raw data into reliable insights and well-evaluated models
that support informed decision-making.

I have hands-on experience designing **data ingestion and transformation pipelines**,
working with structured and semi-structured data, and enabling downstream analytics,
feature engineering, and machine learning workflows. On top of these data foundations,
I develop and evaluate ML and GenAI systems for tasks such as **reasoning optimization,
hallucination mitigation, anomaly detection, and risk analysis**, emphasizing rigor,
robustness, and reproducibility.

My interest lies on applying AI in a **responsible and privacy-aware manner**,
prioritizing **data quality, transparent metrics, and alignment with business objectives**.
I am particularly interested in roles where data systems, model behavior, and trustworthiness intersect.
